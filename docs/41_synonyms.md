## Synonyms

In a previous section, when we looked at the `text_general` field type, we noticed that it used a filter to handle synonyms at query time.

Here is how to view that definition again:

```
$ curl 'http://localhost:8983/solr/bibdata/schema/fieldtypes/text_general'

  #
  # "queryAnalyzer":{
  #   "tokenizer":{
  #     ...
  #   },
  #   "filters":[
  #     ...
  #     {
  #       "class":"solr.SynonymGraphFilterFactory",
  #       "expand":"true",
  #       "ignoreCase":"true",
  #       "synonyms":"synonyms.txt"
  #     },
  #     ...
  #
```

Notice how one of the filter uses the `SynonymGraphFilterFactory` to handle synonyms and references a file `synonyms.txt`.

The file `synonyms.txt` can be found on the configuration folder for our `bibdata` core under `~/solr-7.4.0/server/solr/bibdata/conf/synonyms.txt` If you take a look at the contents of this file you'll see a definition for synonyms for "television"

```
$ cat ~/solr-7.4.0/server/solr/bibdata/conf/synonyms.txt

  #
  # will include a few lines including
  #
  # GB,gib,gigabyte,gigabytes
  # Television, Televisions, TV, TVs
  #
```


### Life without synonyms

In the data in our `bibdata` core several of the books have the words "twentieth century" in the title but these books would not be retrieved if a user were to search for "20th century".

Let's try it, first let's search for `q=title:"twentieth century"`:

```
$ curl 'http://localhost:8983/solr/bibdata/select?fl=id,title&q=title:"twentieth+century"'

  #
  # result will include 29 results
  #
```

And now let's search for `q=title:"20th century"`:

```
$ curl 'http://localhost:8983/solr/bibdata/select?fl=id,title&q=title:"20th+century"'

  #
  # result will include 4 results
  #
```

### Adding synonyms

We can indicate Solr that "twentieth" and "20th" are synonyms by updating the `synonyms.txt` file by adding a like as follows:

```
20th,twentieth
```

You can do this with your favorite editor or with a command like this:

```
$ echo "20th,twentieth" >> ~/solr-7.4.0/server/solr/bibdata/conf/synonyms.txt
```

You *must reload your core* for the changes to the `synonyms.txt` to take effect. You can do this as follow:

```
$ curl 'http://localhost:8983/solr/admin/cores?action=RELOAD&core=bibdata'

  # response will look similar to this
  # {
  # "responseHeader":{
  #   "status":0,
  #   "QTime":221}}
  #
```

You can also reload the core via the [Solr Admin](http://localhost:8983/solr/#/) page. Select "Core Admin", then "bibdata", and click "Reload".

If you run the queries again they will both report "33 results found" regardless of whether  you search for `q=title:"twentieth century"` or `q=title:"20th century"`:

```
$ curl 'http://localhost:8983/solr/bibdata/select?fl=id,title&q=title:"twentieth+century"'

  #
  # result will include 33 results
  #
```
