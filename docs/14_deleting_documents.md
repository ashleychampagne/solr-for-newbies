## Deleting documents
To delete all documents for the `bibdata` core we can submit a request to Solr's
`update` endpoint (rather than the `select` endpoint) with a command like this:

```
$ curl "http://localhost:8983/solr/bibdata/update?commit=true" --data '<delete><query>id:00020424</query></delete>'
```

The body of the request (`--data`) indicates to Solr that we want to delete a specific document (notice the `id:00020424` query).

We can also pass a less specific query like `title:teachers` to delete all documents where the title includes the word "teachers" (or a variation of it). Or we can delete *all documents* with a query like `*:*`.

Be aware that even if you delete all documents from a Solr core the schema and the core's configuration will remain intact. For example, the fields that were defined are still available even if no documents exist in the core anymore.

If you want to delete the entire core (documents, schema, and other configuration associated with it) you can use the Solr delete command instead:

```
$ ~/solr-7.4.0/bin/solr delete -c bibdata
```

be aware that you will need to re-create the core if you want to re-import data to it.
